For K. Pearson, only the probility distribution make sence. For example, Drawin's finches is not the object of research, but the distribution of finch population. For a kind of finch, if we can meansure beak's length of total finch, we will obtain four parameters of distribution function of beak's length, which is represente beak's length. The four parameters in K. Pearson system are:At the bgein of 20 century, Weldon designed a experiment to confirm surival of the fittest. During the devolopment of china in Southern England, water outside harbour was less silt than inside. Weldon collected hundred of crabs from Plymouth and Dartmouth, and cultured in bottles. Half of crabs lived in water outside harbour, and other crabs lived in water inside harbour. After some time, Weldon measure the shell of living crabs. Reasonalbily, parameters changed! However, Weldon was dead before finishing this report.Pearson was import in the founding of the school of biometrics, which was a competing theory to describe evolution and population inheritance at the turn of the 20th century.(wikipedia). It is intersting that, the biometric school, unlike the Mendelians, focused not on providing a mechanism for inheritance, but rather on providing a mathematical description for inheritance, but rather on providing a mathematical description for inheritance that was not causal in nature. Pearson criticized biologists who did not focus on the statistical validity of their theories, stating that "before we can accept [any cause of a progressive change] as a factor we must have not only shown its plausibility but if possible have demonstrated its quantitative ability(The grammer of science).The usage of chi-square and P value. how continuous variation could result from a number of discrete genetic loci. During 1920s, B.S Haldane applied mathematical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the evolution of industrial melanism in pepered moths. Haldane established that natural selection could work even faster than Fisher had assumed. Making it firmly based in mathermatical modelling, its predictions confirmed by experiment , Natural selsetion , once considerd hoplessly unverfiable speculation abou history, was becoming predicated, meansurable, and testable.De Netural Theory, modern synthesishttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin
